## [Project 1: Predicting the correctness of exercise performance](https://github.com/nravinskaya/practicalMachineLearning)

This is my course project for the **"Practical Machine Learning"** [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The goal of this project is to predict how people performed exercises based on data about personal movement that were collected from accelerometers on their bodies. 

I built four models, two for each algorithm **random forest** and **decision tree**, using several R packages. Based on the results of the accuracy assessment, the first of the considered models was selected to complete the final test. As a result of applying my machine learning algorithm to the test data, **all cases were predicted correctly**.

## [Project 2: Next word prediction (Pitch)](https://rpubs.com/NRavinskaya/707928)

My Shiny App suggests one or more words that could continue your phrase, based on the words you typed in English. It is my capstone project for the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). I am not allowed to publish the complete code of the final project, but [here you can see my interim report](https://rpubs.com/NRavinskaya/671485) on a small amount of data. The logic of the final project is about the same, but the data preparation was performed using more efficient methods.

## [Project 3: Web page created with Leaflet](https://github.com/nravinskaya/WebPageCreatedWithLeaflet)

Here is an interactive map of Berlin with filming locations of some of my favorite movie.
