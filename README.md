## [Project 1: Predicting the correctness of exercise performance](https://github.com/nravinskaya/practicalMachineLearning)

This is my course project for the **"Practical Machine Learning"** course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The goal of this project is to predict how people performed exercises based on data about personal movement that were collected from accelerometers on their bodies. 

I built four models, two for each algorithm **random forest** and **decision tree**, using several R packages.  
Based on the results of the accuracy assessment, the first of the considered models was selected to complete the final test.  
As a result of applying my machine learning algorithm to the test data, **all cases were predicted correctly**.
